# About

I'm a Senior Data Scientist at [Grow Progress](https://growprogress.ai/), where I build our platform for fast, cost-effective, and easily interpretable message testing at scale. Before this, I was a Manager of Data Science at [605](https://www.605.tv/), where I worked on problems of causal inference, forecasting, and persuadability modeling.

Some recurring themes of my work are modern methods for survey weighting, efficient estimation of causal effects, and scalable Bayesian inference. Examples
of each of these can be found on my blog.

Before grad school, I was a field and data staffer up and down the ballot in Minnesota. When not thinking about politics, I can most often be found running, reading, or playing chess.

This site showcases some of my larger side projects, particularly those benefiting from expository writing.
