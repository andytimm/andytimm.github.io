    "text": "About\nI’m currently a Manager of Data Science at 605, where I work on problems of observational inference and persuadability modeling, helping our corporate and political clients to better understand the impact of their advertising campaigns and optimize their targeting. Previously, I was a grad student at NYU Gallatin, where I was lucky to have the freedom to study a wide variety of topics in political science, statistics, and data science.\nMethodologically, I am passionate about quantifying uncertainty in observational inference; when we work on the many essential political and business questions that cannot be approached with experiments, how do we rigorously understand the uncertainty and limitations that come with observational methods? Some of my substantive interests include the increasing prominence of white identity in American politics, and the extent to which voting is habit forming.\nBefore grad school, I was a field and data staffer up and down the ballot in Minnesota. When not thinking about politics, I can most often be found running, reading, or playing chess.\nMy aim with this space is to show off some of my larger side projects, especially those that would benefit from some expository writing. I’ll also include occasional career updates.\nThis new website is still very much a WIP. Thanks to Drew Dimmery for starting point for this and post on how to make a quick Quarto website!\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Bookshelf as of September 2022.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Race is a defining part of political identity in the United States, and so it should be no surprise that accurately modeling race can be beneficial for many political campaign activities. For instance, many organizations work to improve turnout in specific communities of color, or want to target persuasion on a given issue to certain racial group. Alternatively, race and ethnicity might be desired as an input to a larger voting or support likelihood model, given that race is generally predictive of both voting likelihood and candidate support.\nUnfortunately, complete self-reported race data is only available in 7 states, where it is required by law: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Pennsylvania and Tennessee also have an optional field on voter registration forms. Outside of these states, race and ethnicity need to be collected individually, or modeled. These models commonly take advantage of the name (especially surname) of the individual voter, and other information in the voter file to do so.\nIn this post, I’ll explore a Bayes’ rule based method for modeling racial identity, and how it can be extended with additional information from state voter files where available. Obviously, it won’t be as predictive as something like Catalist or Civis Analytics’ ones (which have the benefit of huges swathes of additional survey and other data, not to mention more sophisticated modeling), but it can help illustrate the benfits and limitations of such tools. In the next posts, I’ll explain how natural language processing models can achieve still higher accuracy by extracting more information from names themselves. Since the Florida voter file has self-reported race data and is easy to access, we’ll test our models’ effectiveness against that ground truth."

    "section": "A simple first method",
    "text": "A simple first method\nThe census surname files are a an incredible source of information on how race correlates with names, and are the starting point of our model. In these files, the census provides race percentage breakdowns for any surname with more than 100 occurrences in the United States, except where redacted for privacy reasons. The data is available only aggregated at the national level. In practice, this means coverage of about 90% of the population.\nFor many voters, surname is the only information we need to make an accurate classification: names such as Carlson, Meyer, and Hanson are in excess of 90% white, with similar surnames existing for other races. Unfortunately, many names aren’t as clear cut, and some names like Chavis are less than 40% likely to be any race. This is a good starting point, but we can do better.\nAs our first improvement, Elliot et al. (2009) incorporates census geolocation (county, tract, or block) data, using Bayes’ theorem.\nBayes’ theorem is a natural way to integrate the new census evidence we have, updating our initial beliefs with more data. P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of events A and B occurring independently of each other, and P(A \\vert B) and P(B \\vert A) are conditional probabilities, such as the probability a given voter is white given their surname, or P(white \\vert surname). Bayes’ theorem appears in it’s simplest form below, giving us an updated probability utilizing the new information:\n P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \nOf course, we’re interested in integrating multiple pieces of evidence (surname/geolocation for now, with more coming later), and applying it to multiple voters. The equations will be much more involved, but remember that we’re essentially just extending the above equation to work with multiple inputs, over multiple voters. Note that I’ll be using the notation from Imai and Khanna (2016), which is somewhat clearer than the notion from Elliot et al.\nWe want P(R_i = r \\vert S_i = s, G_i = g), the conditional probability that the voter i belongs to the racial group r given their surname s and geolocation g. R, S, and G are the sets of all racial groups, all surnames, and all geolocations respectively. Thus, as a final expression we’ll get:\nP(R_i = r \\vert S_i = s, G_i = g) = \\frac{P(G_i = g \\vert R_i = r) P(R_i = r|S_i = s)}{\\sum_{r'\\in R} P(G_i = g|R_i = r) P(R_i = r|S_i = s) }\nWe already have almost all these probabilities between the census surname list and census demographic data. P(R_i = r \\vert S_i = s) is the racial composition of surnames from the surname list. But what about P(G_i = g \\vert R_i = r)? As an intermediate step, we first need to calculate P(G_i = g \\vert R_i = r) , which we can calculate using Bayes’ rule again. P(G_i = g \\vert R_i = r) is then \\frac{P(R_i = r \\vert G_i = g) P(G_i = g)} {\\sum_{r'\\in R} P(R_i = r \\vert G_i = g') P(G_i = g)}, completing everything we need to produce our second model.\nThis model, like the surname list, produces probabilistic predictions of race, for instance, a given voter is 94.3% likely to be white, given their name and geolocation. The probabilities sum to 1 across the races.\nWe’ll get to how to use and evaluate such models soon, but first: given that we’ve started to include information from the voter file to improve our predictions, why don’t we use other fields we have such as age, party registration, and gender? They all are likely to contain some conditional information about a voter’s race, and while party registration isn’t reported in every state, it is in Florida.\nThat’s exactly the proposal of Imai and Khanna (2016), and it works well. The equations get slightly more complicated, but extending Bayes’ rule to include more and more variables doesn’t change all that much. We have to calculate more intermediate probabilities, but the essential process and reasoning of incorporating new information to update our belief is the same. If you want to see the full model written out, with space for an arbitrary number of new variables X_i, you can find it in the linked paper."

    "section": "Use and Evaluation",
    "text": "Use and Evaluation\nNow that we have a probability distribution over the racial groups, how do we utilize them?\nWe might take the highest probability race and use that as our prediction. Alternatively, as an input in a later model, we might choose to simply incorporate all 5 probabilities, allowing our following model as much information as possible about the racial identity of a voter. Catalist, the democratic data vendor, turns probabilities into simple categories such as “likely white” or “possibly black”, which simplify working with the results on a campaign.\nAs a final idea, we might have an application in mind where you want to only predict a certain race when you’re very confident in your prediction. For example, you might be hoping to target a turnout mailer written in Spanish to only Hispanics, and as few non-Hispanics as possible. To do this, we’d utilize only high probability predictions- say, above 85% likely to be Hispanic. By changing that threshold, you could optimize the size of your mail universe versus the specificity and efficiency of it, finding the best balance for your campaign.\nAs our last example showed, when utilizing such probabilistic predictions, there is naturally an accuracy tradeoff involved in selecting what type of threshold to use. We could misleadingly say our model is extremely accurate if we only use a high threshold, but a fairer, more systematic evaluation would require looking at how it preforms over multiple such thresholds. That’s what we’ll develop next: Area Under the Curve (AUC), a systematic method for evaluating classifiers.\nThere are 4 possible outcomes to making a classification: a True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), True negative (TN), and False Negative (FN). As an example then, a true positive is when we predicted positive, and the ground truth label was actually positive.\nRather than building a table of these 4 outcomes, called a confusion matrix, we’ll be working with summary statistics of these outcomes. The True Positive Rate (or sensitivity or recall) is \\frac{TP}{TP+FN}. In other words, out of all the points that are (ground truth) positive, how many did we correctly classify? Similarly, the False Positive Rate is \\frac{FP}{FP+TN}. High True Positive Rate is good: it means we’ll miss relatively few positive examples. On the other end of things, low False Positive Rate is what we want: it means fewer negative points will be misclassified.\nBy calculating these two statistics at a variety of thresholds, then plotting a curve with the FPR on the x-axis and TPR on the y-axis, we can get a deeper understanding of the tradeoff. This is called an Receiver Operating Characteristic. Given what I’ve said about the meaning of the TPR and FPR, can you figure out quality of the 3 classifiers that are graphed below?\n The first is a perfect classifier: at all tradeoff points, it has a TPR of 1, and FPR of 0. The second is pretty good: at most tradeoff points it does well. The third, a straight line from (0, 0) to (1,1) is a random classifier: it’s equivalent to guessing.\nAs an overall summary then, the area under this curve (AUC) is of our one number summary of these graphs. The shown classifiers have AUC 1, .8, and .5 respectively."

With more data, each subsequent model does better, and the overall result is strong.\nBlack: Interestingly, the kitchen sink model still does the best overall with black voters, but by a much smaller margin than with whites. Also, once the true positive rate gets to around .90, curves cross! This is a good illustration of the importance of plotting ROC curves when doing classification- depending on your campaign, you might correctly choose either the Geo/Surname model or the Kitchen Sink one, depending on what type of cutoff you need.\nHispanic: The Hispanic models are all very close together: with surname information being so effective in classifying Hispanics (more effective than any model for the other races), there isn’t much room for census or voter file data to improve things.\nAsian: These models are significantly weaker than all the others, but still reasonable. The unexpected trend though, is that the kitchen sink model preforms much worse than the other two. Given how few Asian voters there are overall in Florida, this downturn is probably explained by the relatively low density of any Asians across the other inputs, like age, sex, or party. Thus, while geographic information might slightly improve things, Floridians are so unlikely to be Asian overall that all of those extra variables don’t carry any useful information about who might be Asian.\nOverall, these Bayes’ Theorem models have a lot of attractive features. While the predictiveness of names, and what variables you have from the voter file might vary state to state, the models can used anywhere in the US. They’re also quite a strong baseline for accuracy as well- far, far better than random, even for Asian voters. Unlike models we’ll discuss in the next post, these models require no training data. Finally, they’re transparent- if you want to check how surname, geolocation, and party weighed in to a particular decision, it’s only a few calculations with Bayes’ rule away.\nOf course, we’d love higher accuracy, and we can get there with natural language processing. What about those ~10% of voters whose name aren’t in the census surname file? If a name starts with “Mc”, but isn’t in the census surname list, I personally would guess they’re of Irish descent, and therefore white. And what about using first names, middle names, and name suffixes? It’s linguistic patterns like these that we’ll hope to exploit with NLP, in the next post.\nYou can find the code used to write this post here."

Bayes’ theorem appears in it’s simplest form below, giving us an updated probability utilizing the new information:\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{timm,\n  author = {Andy Timm},\n  editor = {},\n  title = {Testing Latex Paragraph Breaks},\n  url = {https://andytimm.github.io/test_latex_paragraph_break_bug.html},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAndy Timm. n.d. “Testing Latex Paragraph Breaks.” https://andytimm.github.io/test_latex_paragraph_break_bug.html."

    "text": "I always learn a ton about people’s interests by hearing about what projects they’re excited about. If you’re working on similar things, and want to talk about them more or learn together, I’m always excited to chat (especially if you’re doing the work for social good)!\nHere are some current work and personal projects I’m particularly excited about:\n\n\n\nPersonal Projects\n\nUpskilling on Variational Inference: with a particular focus on techniques like normalizing flows which improve our ability to correctly quantify uncertainty 1.\nStudying Declining US Social Capital: Building a better knowledge base on declining social capital in the US, and the implications of this, especially for politics2.\nLearning more about Effective Altruism: especially longtermism, and evaluating how interested I am becoming more involved in the community3.\n\n\n\n\nWork Projects\n\nBetter Polling Methods: Improving our political survey methodology choices to improve our resulting model quality in the 2022 midterm elections4.\nProductizing HTE Estimation: Exploring which Heterogeneous Treatment Effect models perform best in our industry in a variety of contexts, with an eye towards a fully productized solution in early 20235.\nBetter CI’s when Identification is Weak: Improving our uncertainty quantification when using observational methods with weaker identification strategies6.\n\n\nI also want to start building out a broader list of topics that I’ve spent time with or want to do a deeper dive in. For example, last winter I spent a ton of time exploring Potential Outcome vs DAG approaches to causal inference. In grad school I was particularly focused on the effects of educational polarization in the US, etc. As a future example, I want to do a broader dive into how social media effects culture and politics. This is both a personal thing (to track what I’ve been interested in over the years), and a social one (I love sharing resources and working with others to learn these topics).\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nI started this out by working through Depth First Learning’s Variational Inference with Normalizing Flows curriculum. Next, I plan to implement a couple of MRP models with various flavors of VI, and see how it holds up to a MCMC version.↩︎\nFor this, I’m reading some of Putnam’s work since Bowling Alone, and a bunch of papers in the vein of this Nature paper.↩︎\nHaving read WWOTF, I’m now reading The Precipice and plan to read Doing Good Better. In addition, reading a bunch of the EA Forum. Since I already think about maximizing my social impact, there are a lot of appealing ideas here. I have two cruxes here: first, I’m not sure if I trust EA’s commitment to being non-political- as laid out here and here. Second, I’m not yet sure I buy the math behind the heavy focus on existential risk causes.↩︎\nNone of these links will get at any IP, but broadly I’m synthesizing a lot of what I learned from AAPOR 2022 (this thread is a good starting point) and examining how some decent ideas would’ve changed our recent predictions.↩︎\nThere are a ton of ideas to explore here, but some of the most promising are double/debiased ML estimators, Meta Learners, and other ideas explored in recent ACIC competitions.↩︎\nIf we’re trying to estimate a causal effect without an experiment or believable instrument, and have to rely on covariate adjustment-esque strategies, how can we quantify our uncertainty? Can we reason about plausible sizes of unobserved confounders and in so doing move the discussion past “you needed to control for U”? If we can make such claims, can we use them to then define uncertainty intervals which reflect our various levels of plausibility for such concerns?↩︎"

    "text": "retrodesign\nretrodesign provides tools for working with Type S (Sign) and Type M (Magnitude) errors, as proposed in Gelman and Tuerlinckx (2000) and Gelman & Carlin (2014). In addition to simply calculating the probability of Type S/M error, the package includes functions for calculating these errors across a variety of effect sizes for comparison, and recommended sample size given “tolerances” for Type S/M errors. To improve the speed of these calculations, closed forms solutions for the probability of a Type S/M error from Lu, Qiu, and Deng (2018) are implemented. The broader goal of this project was to make it easier for researchers to understand these issues in their work, and it’s gratifying the package has been able to do that.\n\n        \n        Website\n     \n        \n        Github\n     \n        \n        Package"
