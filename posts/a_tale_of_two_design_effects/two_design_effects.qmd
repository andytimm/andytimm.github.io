Now that the cycle is over, and I have a bit more time to write, I want to 
unpack some interesting (also, *frustrating*) moments in polling that occurred this cycle.

Let's start with one that occupied pollster twitter for several days: are we all
dirty herders? Or are we just increasingly weighting on quite predictive things like party or 2020 vote choice? Moreover,
why do these look similar to so many folks, and what could pollsters have done
to avoid this misconception?

Here's a rough outline:

1. Weighting **can** reduce variance (I'll show how), but some people interpreted low variability
of 2024 vote choice estimates relative to polls' stated margins of error as
a blindingly obvious sign of herding.
2. The above misconception isn't terribly surprising, given how pervasively our industry tends to think
of and communicate about variance and weighting in terms of Kish's design effect. I'll explain how
Kish's design effect generally encodes an assumption about weighting increasing variance,
and show an alternative design effect (Henry/Valliant) that does correctly get smaller when weighting
should reduce variance.
3. ...But any discussion of design effects that get *smaller* due to weighting need to grapple
with the fact that empirically, **our MoE's are generally far too narrow, not too wide**. As Andrew
Gelman loves to say, take the stated MoE, and double it to get a realistic one. So
to square that circle, I'll discuss about what each deff gets right and wrong,
and sketch out about what more ambitious uncertainty quantification could look like.

More ambitiously, I'd like to use this post as a jumping off point to discuss the design based
inference roots of the polling industry, and the tensions that perspective faces
as accuracy increasingly demands a more and more model based approach
in the era of low responses rates and broad adoption of non-probability methods.
