The wonderful Jim Savage calls the MaxDiff model of discrete choice a "mathematically
incorrect model of a psychologically incoherent concept"[^1].

Despite this lovely dunk,
and some lovely accompanying notes explaining why, the model remains frequently used in market
research, most prominently as implemented in [Sawtooth](https://sawtoothsoftware.com/). Why is this?

Putting aside the most obvious answers like inertia and a dim view of statistical practice in marketing, it's surprisingly hard to find a fully fleshed out explanation of the alternatives online. In this post, I do just that, with sections for:

1. Introducing MaxDiff and its blemishes
2. Showing how the issues propagate into final model quality
3. Alternatives

# Introducing MaxDiff

## The basic model

## Psycologically Incoherent

## Mathmatically Incorrect

# The defects are not theoretical or cosmetic: an illustration

# Alternative #1: rank-ordered logits with connected graphs of choices

# Alternative #2: a backup plan- rank-ordered logits with ties

# Stepping Back: the utility of discrete choice more broadly

[^1]: The smiley face is there to make sure MaxDiff stays down :-D
