Ahead of starting a new gig next week (wooo!), I was reviewing a bit about
multilevel models, and came across this fascinating footnote in Richard McElreath's
[Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/):

> See Jaynes (1986) for an entertaining example concerning the beer preferences
of left-handed kangaroos. There is an updated 1996 version of this paper available
online.

I'm not sure what it is with Bayesians and wild footnotes[^1], but obviously
I couldn't not chase this one down. Also, the paper didn't immediately pop
up when I googled "beer preferences of left-handed kangaroos", so hopefully this post
gets a few people where they're going.


# Why on earth are we talking about kangroo's beer preferences?

To be clear, we're actually talking about the *beer preferences of kangaroos
