Ahead of starting a new gig next week (wooo!), I was reviewing a bit about
multilevel models, and came across this fascinating footnote in Richard McElreath's
[Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/):

> See Jaynes (1986) for an entertaining example concerning the beer preferences
of left-handed kangaroos. There is an updated [1996 version](https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmonkeys.pdf) of this paper available
online.

I'm not sure what it is with Bayesians and wild, fantastic adventures in the footnotes[^1], but obviously
I couldn't not chase this one down. Also, the paper didn't immediately pop
up when I googled "beer preferences of left-handed kangaroos", so hopefully this post
gets a few people where they're going.

I mostly started this post to have a reason to DALL-E a (left-handed) kangaroo
drinking a Foster's, but the more serious content of the post discusses different
conceptions of maximum entropy, and how useful the idea is in building prior
distributions for Bayesian inference.


# Why on earth are we talking about kangroos' beer preferences?

To be clear, we're actually talking about the *joint distribution of beer preferences of kangaroos
and their handedness*. Why?

In the time-honored tradition of taking a joke and continuing to run with it
until it's funny, E.T. Jaynes is extending an example due to Steve Gull[^2] to discuss
the properties of [maximum entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy) priors:


![](imgs/problem_setup.png){fig-align="center"}

Extending analysis of this scenario then
provides a tutorial in prior specification.

For example, the first piece of intuitive prior knowledge that Jaynes shares
is that kangaroos are (for most practical purposes) indivisible[^3]. Constraining acceptable priors
to ones with integer solutions tweaks the problem and corresponding reasonable
priors a bit.

From there, the article provides a nice example of a difficult Bayesian task:
taking our priors seriously, and seeing how we feel about what they imply. For example, when
taken to large N[^4], the simplest maximum entropy prior starts to become
remarkably confident about the unknown proportions $p$ above. The question that arises
is whether our intuition about $p$ were poor, or whether we have hidden prior
information to incorporate (i.e: do we know that kangaroos are likely to be
related given they are drawn from the same genetic pool and environment)?

![As I often ask myself...](imgs/hidden_kangaroo_knowledge.png){fig-align="center"}

With the ensuing sermon[^5], Jaynes makes the case that maximum entropy remains
a useful, logical tool for building priors. Interestingly, this argument has a
different presentation of maxent than more recent pieces that place these priors alongside
reference, Jeffreys, or invariance-based priors[^6]. Jaynes instead lays out
a presentation that feels more like a workflow, with maximum entropy itself
providing a starting point.

# But first, more kangaroo facts

Just like our understanding of Bayesian inference has advanced since the 1980s,
so has our understanding of kangaroo handedness.

sure if the dropbear or  ʇxǝʇ uʍop ǝpᴉsdn jokes existed back then this problem
would have been about the preferred reading angles of drop bears or something instead.
[^3]: If one did divide a kangaroo, would it still have a preference for Fosters?
I suppose it would depend on the type of division, but I have to imagine most
types of division would leave the kangaroo desiring something a bit stronger.
