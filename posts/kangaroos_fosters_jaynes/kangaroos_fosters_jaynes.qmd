Ahead of starting a new gig next week (wooo!), I was reviewing a bit about
multilevel models, and came across this fascinating footnote in Richard McElreath's
[Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/):

> See Jaynes (1986) for an entertaining example concerning the beer preferences
of left-handed kangaroos. There is an updated [1996 version](https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmonkeys.pdf) of this paper available
online.

I'm not sure what it is with Bayesians and wild, fantastic adventures in the footnotes[^1], but obviously
I couldn't not chase this one down. Also, the paper didn't immediately pop
up when I googled "beer preferences of left-handed kangaroos", so hopefully this post
gets a few people where they're going.


# Why on earth are we talking about kangroo's beer preferences?

To be clear, we're actually talking about the *joint distribution of beer preferences of kangaroos
and their handedness*. Why?

In the time-honored tradition of taking a joke and continuing to run with it
until it's funny, E.T. Jaynes is extending an example due to Steve Gull[^2] to discuss
the properties of [maximum entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy) priors:

Extending analysis of this scenario based on clarifying our prior knowledge then
provides a tutorial in prior specification.

[^2]: Who I have to imagine Australians were thrilled with for this novel joke. I'm
sure if the dropbear or  ʇxǝʇ uʍop ǝpᴉsdn jokes existed back then this problem
would have been about the preferred reading angles of drop bears or something instead.
