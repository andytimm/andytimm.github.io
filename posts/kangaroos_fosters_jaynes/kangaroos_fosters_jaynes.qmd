Ahead of starting a new gig next week (wooo!), I was reviewing a bit about
multilevel models, and came across this fascinating footnote in Richard McElreath's
[Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/):

> See Jaynes (1986) for an entertaining example concerning the beer preferences
of left-handed kangaroos. There is an updated [1996 version](https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmonkeys.pdf) of this paper available
online.

I'm not sure what it is with Bayesians and wild, fantastic adventures in the footnotes[^1], but obviously
I couldn't not chase this one down. Also, the paper didn't immediately pop
up when I googled "beer preferences of left-handed kangaroos", so hopefully this post
gets a few people where they're going.

I mostly started this post to have a reason to DALL-E a (left-handed) kangaroo
drinking a Foster's, but the more serious content of the post discusses different
conceptions of maximum entropy, and how useful the idea is in building prior
distributions for Bayesian inference.


# Why on earth are we talking about kangroos' beer preferences?

To be clear, we're actually talking about the *joint distribution of beer preferences of kangaroos
and their handedness*. Why?

In the time-honored tradition of taking a joke and continuing to run with it
until it's funny, E.T. Jaynes is extending an example due to Steve Gull[^2] to discuss
the properties of [maximum entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy) priors:


![](imgs/problem_setup.png){fig-align="center"}

Extending analysis of this scenario then
provides a tutorial in prior specification.

For example, the first piece of intuitive prior knowledge that Jaynes shares
is that kangaroos are (for most practical purposes) indivisible[^3]. Constraining acceptable priors
to ones with integer solutions tweaks the problem and corresponding reasonable
priors a bit.

From there, the article provides a nice example of a difficult Bayesian task:
taking our priors seriously, and seeing how we feel about what they imply. For example, when
taken to large N[^4], the simplest maximum entropy prior starts to become
remarkably confident about the unknown proportions $p$ above. The question that arises
is whether our intuition about $p$ were poor, or whether we have hidden prior
information to incorporate (i.e: do we know that kangaroos are likely to be
related given they are drawn from the same genetic pool and environment)?

![As I often ask myself...](imgs/hidden_kangaroo_knowledge.png){fig-align="center"}

With the ensuing sermon[^5], Jaynes makes the case that maximum entropy remains
a useful, logical tool for building priors. Interestingly, this argument has a
different presentation of maxent than more recent pieces that place these priors alongside
reference, Jeffreys, or invariance-based priors[^6]. Jaynes instead lays out
a presentation that feels more like a workflow, with maximum entropy itself
providing a starting point.

# But first, more kangaroo facts

Just like our understanding of Bayesian inference has advanced since the 1980s,
so has our understanding of kangaroo handedness.

[Giljov et al. (2015)](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(15)00617-X#articleInformation)
study several members of the broader family of macropod[^7] marsupials, and find
that bipedal macropod marsupials show "population-level left-forelimb preference",
confirming Gull's observations above.

This was studied by observing the natural behavior of the different species in
a variety of common tasks, like bipedal/tripedal[^8]/quadrupedal stances for
feeding, self-grooming, and accepting a nice cold can of Foster's[^9].

Ok, so Gull was correct they're broadly left-handed. How accurate was his
65% observation? Here we need to be careful: there are a variety of
macropod marsupials, which display different degrees of left-handedness[^10]. As Jaynes
notes,  Gull was not particularly specific in his formulation of this problem:

> Although there are several species of kangaroos with size varying from man to mouse,
we assume that Gull intended his problem to refer to the man sized species
(who else could stand up at a bar and drink Foster's?)

This seems reasonable enough, but to split unnecessary hairs even further, there
are two different types of "man sized" kangaroos in the study- [red kangaroos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kangaroo)
and [eastern grey kangaroos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_grey_kangaroo)[^11][^12]. Digging into the [appendix](https://www.cell.com/cms/10.1016/j.cub.2015.05.043/attachment/6b90006c-b1dc-4683-97dd-03dabd0fdebc/mmc1) to find the raw data since the main paper
only reports statistical test results, 


[^1]: [Dan Simpson's](https://dansblog.netlify.app/) are particularly incredible.
[^2]: Who I have to imagine Australians were thrilled with for this novel joke. I'm
sure if the dropbear or  ʇxǝʇ uʍop ǝpᴉsdn jokes existed back then this problem
would have been about the preferred reading angles of drop bears or something instead.
[^3]: If one did divide a kangaroo, would it still have a preference for Fosters?
I suppose it would depend on the type of division, but I have to imagine most
types of division would leave the kangaroo desiring something a bit stronger.
[^4]: umber of kangaroos.
[^5]: his wonderful term, not mine.
[^6]: For example, how the [Stan Prior Choice Recommendations](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations#general-principles) page, or [Gelman, Simpson, and Betancourt (2017)](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/19/10/555) which I'll discuss later in the post.
[^7]: See [Macropodidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macropodidae)- basically
all the cute, friend-shaped ones, including kangaroos, wallabies, sugar gliders, quokkas, and
wallaroos (which I just learned of, and am happy to report exist).
[^8]: Three limbs, not the tail, sadly.
[^9]: Ok, ok fine. The authors restricted their attention to "natural, not artificially evoked, behaviors",
and that condition is what presumably ruled out handing any of them a Foster's.
[^10]: The motivating causal theory here is that handedness seems to be more common
in primarily bipedal species, according the [lead author](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/kangaroos-are-lefties-and-can-teach-us-about-human-handedness-180955630/). This connects this work to a larger, interesting debate on whether handedness is a uniquely human,
or primate trait.
[^11]: There are also two other species referred to as kangaroos, the [western
grey kangaroo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_grey_kangaroo), and the [antilopine kangaroo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilopine_kangaroo). Note that the term "kangaroo" is
a [paraphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly) grouping, and seems to be based on size, so, for example, I found some references to the antilopine kangaroo being referred to as a wallaby or wallaroo. I was thus unable to verify Jaynes' claim of mouse-sized kangaroos, and presume he was thinking of other Macropodidae. Fortunately, neither of the other two species should undermine our confidence in the study's ability to tell us about the man sized kangaroos capable of standing up at a bar and drinking: while both the eastern and red kangaroo can easily stand over a bar, with male heights often observed roughly around 6'7" and 5'11" respectively, the western grey kangaroo only reaches typical heights of 4'3" (unclear if this is males only, or all of them), and the antilopine kangaroo males only reaching 3'9". If we instead restricted our attention to just the [typical height of a bar](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=typical+height+of+a+bar) however, and take a typical bar height to be 42", we might have some further decisions to make, as both species would (for the tallest members) only narrowly be taller than the bar, and might not be able to comfortably drink at one. In addition, we would need to take into consideration the bartender's willingness to serve such small patrons...
[^12]: Second footnote to say all average male heights in the first footnote are just from the linked Wikipedia pages. I'm in a footnote for a footnote here, which in turn is referring to a paper I found to validate a comment in a 28 year old paper referencing a 41 year old anecdote. If you nitpick me on the roo heights with more precise information about the distribution of their heights, I'll laugh at you, but I will update the text. If you argue whether we care about length of the roo (including tail), not height, I'll just laugh at you.
