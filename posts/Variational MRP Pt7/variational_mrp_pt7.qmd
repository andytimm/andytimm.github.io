This is the final post in my series about using Variational Inference to speed up complex Bayesian models, such as Multilevel Regression and Poststratification. Ideally, we want to do this without the approximation being of hilariously poor quality.

The last few posts in the series have explored several different major advances
in black box variational inference. This post puts a bunch of these tools together
to build a pretty decent approximation that runs ~5x faster than MCMC, and points
to some other advances in BBVI I haven't had time to cover in the series.

The other posts in the series are:

1.  Introducing the Problem- Why is VI useful, why VI can produce spherical cows
2.  How far does iteration on classic VI algorithms like mean-field and full-rank get us?
3.  Problem 1: KL-D prefers exclusive solutions; are there alternatives?
4.  Problem 2: Not all VI samples are of equal utility; can we weight them cleverly?
5.  Problem 3: How can we get deeply flexible variational approximations; are Normalizing Flows the answer?
6.  **(This post)** Problem 4: How can we know when VI is wrong? Are there useful error bounds?
7.  Putting it all together

# Cutting to the chase

To cut to the chase, the new and improved variational approximation is looking
pretty, pretty good!

Like with the simpler meanfield and fullrank models from earlier in the series, this has the medians basically correct, but we also have reasonable uncertainty estimation too. First, the
state distributions are much more smooth and unimodal- no more "lumpy" distributions
with odd spikes of probability that make no sense as a model of public opinion. Further,
the approximation is more consistent: while there's still some variation state
to state in how closely VI matches MCMC, pretty much all states are reasonable.

Certainly, we're still to some degree understating the full size of MCMC's
credible interval. Considering this model runs in an hour and change versus
MCMC's 8 hours on 60,000 datapoints (!), this feels pretty acceptable. As I'll write
a bit more about later, there are a few ways to trade compute and/or time to
fill out the CI's as well.

Last time we look at a variational approximation in post 2, we found a dot plot
was a significantly more exacting standard which made it clear how bad the
first try at VI in the series was. How does that look here?

![](plots/dot_plot.png){width=100%}

Again, pretty solid- no more weird spikes, and the concentration of mass
looks pretty comparable (if a bit compressed) versus MCMC. VI is now much more
uncertain about the same states as MCMC, and no longer shows any signs of degenerate
optimization to fit data points. Nice!

Finally, how are the diagnostics we learned in the last point? The $\hat{k}$ is .9, which is at least much improved[^1]. The approximation is good enough that the Wasserstein
bounds aren't tight enough to inform us much about any issues[^2], although
we should be a bit careful in trusting them giving that $\hat{k}$. In one sense,
none of the diagnostics here are "great", but this is pretty typical of my
experience with BBVI for non-trivial models. We're almost always losing
something from the true posterior, and these diagnostics are not sufficiently
fine-grained to differentiate important from unimportant losses.

# How it works

So the caption above gives some hint, but what all is in this model?

To fit this variational approximation, I'm using Agrawal, Domke, and Sheldon's [vistan](https://github.com/abhiagwl/vistan/tree/master), which is a companion
python package to their great paper [Advances In Black-Box VI](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/c91e3483cf4f90057d02aa492d2b25b1-Paper.pdf).

Here's a separate repository with full setup details, but for purposes of this post, I'll
just reference the parameters of the main setup function here:

```{python}
#| eval: false

vistan.algorithm(
    vi_family = "rnvp",
    full_step_search = True,
    full_step_search_scaling = True,
    step_size_exp = 0,
    step_size_exp_range = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    step_size_base = 0.1,
    step_size_scale = 4.0,
    max_iters = 1000,
    optimizer = 'adam',
    M_iw_train = 1,
    M_iw_sample = 10,
    grad_estimator = "DReG",
    per_iter_sample_budget = 100,
    fix_sample_budget = True,
    evaluation_fn = "IWELBO",
    rnvp_num_transformations =  10,
    rnvp_num_hidden_units =  32,
    rnvp_num_hidden_layers =  2,
    rnvp_params_init_scale =  0.01
)
```

Let's talk about:

1. Normalizing Flows
2. Importance Sampling
3. Optimization
4. Sampling Budgets

### Normalizing Flows

First, this is using a [Real NVP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08803) normalizing
flow, with a fairly small (`10`) number of transformation layers, each of which is using
a pretty shallow neural net (`2 layers, 32 hidden units`). This helps make the approximating distribution
complex enough to handle our model. I didn't find much benefit from either
adding more transform layers or making the neural nets deeper- that sort of makes
sense, since the jump from mean-field or full-rank VI to using a normalizing
flow at all is a fairly big one in terms of model representation capacity.

### Importance Sampling

Second, this is using importance sampling only at the sampling stage, and with
just `10` IW samples per returned sample[^3]. I didn't find much benefit from
importance weighted training[^4] here, although for relatively more complex models
than this I've found it to sometimes matter. As a point of comparison, in their
paper linked above, Agrawal et al. find that about 20% of models actually get
*worse* with IW-Training, and only ~10% get improvements, although those improvements
seem to be clustered in more complex models and can be fairly significant.

At least for this particular model, using 10 importance samples per returned sample during provided most of the benefit of importance weighting, although pushing this
higher to 100 or 200 helped fill out the outcome distribution's tails a bit (more on this in a bit).

### Optimization

Finally, many of the parameters here are about optimization, which we haven't
talked about in this series too much yet, despite it being critical to good performance.

First, Agrawal et al. found that variational
inference is reasonably sensitive to optimization hyperparameters like the step
size the Adam optimizer uses- to handle this, they suggest initial runs
at few different step sizes (in `step_size_exp_range`), selecting the best one via an ELBO average over the whole optimization trace. This model benefits quite a lot from this, and
Agrawal et al.'s results see strong improvements for ~25-30% of models using this
adjustment.

Second, they use the `DReG` gradient estimator, which I'll link out to later, but
is essentially a variant of the reparameterization trick gradient discussed in
post 3 with improved variance, leading to faster convergence.

A final optimization hyperparameter here is the number of iterations (both for that step search
procedure and the final run)- I found `1000` was more than sufficient for optimization of
this model, with going up to 2000 iterations not getting us much benefit, but going
down to 500 leading to a heavily over-dispersed posterior.


### A sample budget?

Since their paper is ultimately a bakeoff, Agrawal et al.'s paper touches on
the theme of a sample budget again and again, and it's a great concept to consider
here. Essentially, a computation budget is somewhat **fungible**: given an amount
of run time, compute available, etc, we can, for example, trade a larger 
`max_iters` for using (more) importance weighted training, or use fewer iterations
for (more) importance weighting our samples. 

How to best spend this budget
is an open question and fairly model dependent- here, I decided not to present
the best model I could possibly fit with variational inference, but the
best one I could get to fit in ~1h. The point of this series is to fit something
nearly as good fast, not a different, more complex way but also in 8h. 

Next, I'll talk through some ideas for what could improve the model further
at greater compute and wall time cost.

# What I might change next

The major shortfall of the current approximation (assuming we continue to mostly care about state level estimates) is the overly narrow credible intervals. If I did want to improve the accuracy of this model, what might I consider next?

The low hanging fruit here would be to use some combination of more samples and/or
more importance weighted samples per retained sample. In my testing this produces
credible intervals about halfway between what I showed above and the MCMC ones, at
the cost of another hour of runtime. It might be possible to go further than
this and get closer to the MCMC interval, but once I was at doubling the run time
that started to feel like cheating. For some applications though, that might be the
right trade off to make!

As I already mentioned above, I didn't find much benefit from more training iterations,
importance weighted training, or making the RNVP component deeper. Thus, if
I wanted to really invest a lot of time to improve this further, my next step
might be to consider fitting another model in parallel to ensemble with this one.
For example, perhaps an objective like the CUBO that tends to emphasize coverage
would be worth combining with this one either via multiple importance sampling
or more simplistic model averaging.

# What I might change for other models

A logical next question: for models in general, which situations suggest
tweaking which hyperparameters? While this is a really hard question, I'll offer
some tentative thoughts:

**The model is compl**

# Other things I didnâ€™t cover

(optimization, better gradients, pathfinder, DIS IKLD)

# Cleaned up files to reproduce

[^1]: This is still not a "good" (< .7) $\hat{k}$, but as we saw in the last post,
$\hat{k}$ is not a infallible metric, especially if you are interested in just
a summary or two of the posterior where any defects it suggests may not be relevant.
My guess is that to get $\hat{k}$ down, we'd need to move much further along
in fully fleshing out the tails of the approximation, but even then we might
still have issues given the dimensionality of this posterior.
[^2]: This happens to me a lot, where these bounds don't really tell me anything
unless a model won't even pass a basic smell test. If you have some counterexamples,
I'd love to see them!
[^3]: The way `vistan` implements importance weighted sampling is to importance
weight N candidate samples and select the highest weight. I'm unsure if this
is an optimal procedure versus keeping all samples and applying the weights,
but it does make the sense in context of their bake off paper, where they want
to maintain some sense of a fixed number of samples to keep comparisons fair.
[^4]: `evaluation_fn = "IWELBO"` is just a quirk of their syntax, where with
`M_iw_train = 1`, it's equivalent to not doing IW-weighted training at all.
