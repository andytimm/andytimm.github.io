This post introduces a series of posts I intend to write, exploring using [Variational Inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods) to massively speed up running complex survey estimation models like variants of [MRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_regression_with_poststratification) while aiming to keep approximation error from completely ruining the model.

The rough plan for the series is as follows:

1. **(This post)** Introducing the Problem- Why is VI useful, why VI can produce spherical cows
2. How far does iteration on classic VI algorithms like mean-field and full rank get us?
3. Some theory on why posterior approximation with VI can be so poor
4. Seeing if some more sophisticated techniques like normalizing flows do
