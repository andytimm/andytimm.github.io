Just pulling a simple variational inference implementation off the shelf and whacking run perhaps unsurprisingly produced dubious models, so in this post we'll bring in long overdue theory to understand why VI is so difficult, and what we can do about it.\n\nThe general structure for this post will be to describe a problem with VI, and then describe how that problem can be fixed to some degree. I also have a grab bag of other interesting ideas from the literature I think are cool, but maybe not as important or interesting to me as the 3 below at the end.\n\nThe rough plan for the series is as follows:\n\n1.  Introducing the Problem- Why is VI useful, why VI can produce spherical cows\n2.  How far does iteration on classic VI algorithms like mean-field and full-rank get us?\n3.  **(This post)** Some theory on why posterior approximation with VI can be so poor\n4.  Better grounded diagnostics and workflow\n5.  Seeing if some more sophisticated techniques like normalizing flows help\n\nDraft problems/solutions:\n\n# Inclusive versus Exclusive KL-divergence\n\nLike I mentioned in the first post in the series, the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), our optimization objective we're working with is a tractable approximation of the Kullback-Leibler Divergence between our choice of approximating distribution $q(z)$ to our true posterior $p(z)$.\n\nThe KL divergence is asymmetric: in general, $KL(p||q) \\neq KL(q||p)$. Previously,\nwe saw that this asymmetry mattered quite a bit for our ELBO idea:\n\n$$argmin_{q(z) \\in \\mathscr{Q}}(q(z)||\\frac{p(z,x)}{\\bf p(x)}) = \\mathbb{E}[logq(z)] - \\mathbb{E}[logp(z,x)] + {\\bf logp(x)}$$\nWe can't calculate the bolded term $logp(x)$; if we could we wouldn't be finding\nthis inference thing so hard in the first place. The way we sidestepped that with\nthe ELBO is to note that the term is constant with respect to $q$; so we can\ngo on our merry way minimizing the above without it.\n\nIf we flip the divergence around though, we've got an issue. That term would\nthen be a $logq(x)$ ... which we can't write off in the same way- it varies as we\noptimize. So if we're\ndoing this ELBO minimizing version of variational inference, we're obligated to\nuse this \"reverse\" KL divergence, the second option below. \n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nKL(p||q) = \\sum_{x \\in X}{p(x)}log[\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}]  \\\\\nKL(q||p) = \\sum_{x \\in X}{q(x)}log[\\frac{q(x)}{p(x)}] \n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nUnfortunately, this choice to optimize the \"reverse\" KL divergence bakes in preference\nfor a certain type of solution[^1]. \n\nI found I built better intuition for this encoded preference after seeing it presented many\ndifferent ways, so here are a few of my favorites.\n\nOne way to see the difference is through a variety of labels for each direction. One could call Forward KL (1) vs. Reverse KL (2):\n1. Inclusive vs. Exclusive (my favorite, and so what I'm using for the section header)\n2. Mean Seeking vs. Mode Seeking\n3. Zero Avoiding vs. Zero Forcing\n\nlet's quickly illustrate this in the case of a simple mixture of normals:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nmixture <- data.frame(normals = c(rnorm(1000,3,1),rnorm(1000,15,2)),\n                      mode_seeking_kl = rnorm(2000,3.5,2),\n                      mean_seeking_kl = rnorm(2000,9,4))\n\nrkl_plot <- mixture %>% ggplot(aes(x = normals)) +\n  geom_density(aes(x = normals), color = \"red\") +\n  geom_density(aes(x = mode_seeking_kl), color = \"green\") + ggtitle(\"Exclusive KL\") +\n  xlab(\"\")\n\nfkl_plot <- mixture %>% ggplot(aes(x = normals)) +\n  geom_density(aes(x = normals), color = \"red\") +\n  geom_density(aes(x = mean_seeking_kl), color = \"green\") + ggtitle(\"Inclusive KL\") +\n  xlab(\"\")\n\ngrid.arrange(rkl_plot,fkl_plot)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](variational_mrp_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo approximate the same exact red distribution $p(x)$, Inclusive KL (1) and Exclusive KL (2)\noptmize the green $q(p)$ in quite different manner. \n\nTo spell out the ways to describe this above: Inclusive KL will try to cover all the probability mass in $p(x)$, even if it means a peak\nat a unfortunate middle ground. Exclusive KL, on the other hand, will try to concentrate\nit's mass on the largest mode, even if it means missing much of the mixture of normals. Alternatively,\nwe could describe the top graph as mode seeking, and the bottom as mean seeking. Finally,\nwe could say the top graph shows \"Zero Forcing\" behavior- it will heavily favor\nputting zero mass on some parts of the graph to avoid any weight where $p(x)$ has no\nmass, even if it means missing an entire mode. Conversely, Inclusive KL will\naim to cover all the mass of $p(x)$ in full even if the result is an odd solution, in order\nto avoid having zero mass where $p(x)$ has some.\n\nHow does this follow from the form of the divergence?\n\nTo start with, notice that for inclusive KL we could think of the $log(\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)})$ part of the term being weighted by $p(x)$- if in some range of $x$ $p(x)$ is 0, we don't pay a penalty if $q(x)$ puts mass. The reverse is not true however- if our $q(x)$ is zero where there should be mass\nin our true distribution, our Inclusive KL divergence is infinite[^2].\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nKL(p||q) = \\sum_{x \\in X}{p(x)}log[\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}]  \\\\\nKL(q||p) = \\sum_{x \\in X}{q(x)}log[\\frac{q(x)}{p(x)}] \n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\n\n\n## CHIVI bound optimization\n\n# Not all points are equal\n\n## PSIS-Variational Inference\n\n# Can we bound error in terms of ELBO or CHIVI?\n\n## Wasserstein Bounds\n\n# Conclusions\n\n[^1]: In truth, both KL divergences encode structural preferences for the type\nof optimization solution they admit- neither will be the right choice for every\nproblem and  variational family combination. But as we'll see, being able to\nchoose will give us more options to fit models we believe.\n[^2]: This is the footnote for those of you that are annoyed because you tried\nto write out how this would happen, and got something like $p(x) log \\frac{p(x)}{0}$,\nwhich should be undefined if we're following normal math rules. But this is information\ntheory, and in this strange land we say $p(x) log \\frac{p(x)}{0} = \\infty$. I don't\nhave a strong intuition for why this is the best solution, but a information encoding perspective\nmakes it make more sense at least: if we know the distribution of $p$,\nwe can construct a code for it with average description length $H(x)$. One way to understand\nthe KL divergence is as what happens when we try to use the code for a distribution $q$ to describe $p$,\nwe'd need $H(p) + KL(p||q)$ bits on average to describe $p$. In the code for $q$ has no way to represent some element of $p$, then requiring... infinite bits feels like the right way to describe the breakdown of meaning?",
